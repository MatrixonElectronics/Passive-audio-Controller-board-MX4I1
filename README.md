# Passive Audio Controller Board
## Overview
The MX4I1 Passive Audio Controller Board is a compact, power-free stereo audio routing module designed for both splitting and mixing line-level audio signals. It features three independent B100K stereo potentiometers (Master, CH1, CH2), RCA connectors, and multiple 3.5mm TRS jacks, making it compatible with a wide range of audio devices.

**The board can operate in two modes:**
- Splitter Mode: Master to CH1 + CH2
- Mixer Mode: CH1 + CH2 to Master

Isolation resistors on CH1 and CH2 protect sources from loading conflicts when mixing signals passively.

## Key Features
- Fully passive design, no external power needed
- 3× B100K stereo potentiometers for Master, CH1, and CH2 level control
- 4× 3.5mm stereo jacks and 2× RCA ports for versatile connectivity
- Supports both stereo splitting and stereo mixing configurations
- 100 Ω isolation resistors on CH1 and CH2 L/R channels
- Compatible with all line-level audio sources
- Clean routing layout with ground-referenced audio paths
- Compact PCB suitable for DIY builds and panel mounting

## Applications
- Passive stereo audio splitter (1 input to 2 outputs)
- Passive stereo mixer (2 inputs to 1 output)
- Multi-device audio distribution
- Volume control between media devices and speakers
- Audio setup for DIY amplifiers or custom rigs
- Portable, noise-free audio mixing without power
